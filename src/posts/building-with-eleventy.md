## How This Site Was Made

A lot of people have been asking me how I built this site. The short answer? **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** and a whole lot of 90s inspiration.

### Why Eleventy?

I chose Eleventy for a few reasons:

1. **Simple** - It's just JavaScript. No complex build processes.
2. **Fast** - Static sites are lightning quick.
3. **Flexible** - Use any template language you want.
4. **No JavaScript Required** - The output is pure HTML and CSS.

Plus, it's perfect for personal sites like this one!

### The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this retro wonderland:

```javascript
{
  "generator": "Eleventy",
  "templates": "Nunjucks",
  "styling": "Pure CSS",
  "hosting": "Your choice!",
  "vibes": "Immaculate"
}
```

### Project Structure

The basic structure looks like this:

```
retroweird/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _includes/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/
â”œâ”€â”€ _data/
â””â”€â”€ .eleventy.js
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Modular Components

Everything is broken down into reusable components:

- Header
- Footer
- Sidebar widgets
- Badge wall
- Guestbook
- Webring

This makes it easy to customize what shows up where.

#### 2. Multiple Themes

I built four different themes:

- **Default** - Classic GeoCities vibes
- **Vaporwave** - A E S T H E T I C
- **GeoCities** - Maximum nostalgia
- **MySpace** - Early 2000s social media

You can switch between them by changing one line in the config!

#### 3. Data-Driven Content

All the customizable stuff lives in JSON files:

- `site.json` - Site settings
- `badges.json` - 88x31 button collection
- `blogroll.json` - Cool links
- `webring.json` - Webring navigation
- `guestbook.json` - Visitor messages

#### 4. IndieWeb Ready

The theme includes support for:

- Microformats2
- RSS feeds
- Webmentions (optional)
- rel="me" links

### The CSS

The styling is pure CSS with CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --font-pixel: 'Silkscreen', monospace;
  --font-display: 'Press Start 2P', monospace;
  --font-body: 'VT323', cursive;
}
```

Each theme overrides these variables to create totally different looks.

### JavaScript Enhancements

The site works perfectly without JavaScript, but I added some fun extras:

- Cursor trail effects
- Random link button
- Visitor counter animation
- Easter eggs (try the Konami code!)

All of it respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.

### Getting Started

5. **Deploy**

### Tips for Retro Design

1. **Embrace maximalism** - More is more!
2. **Use web-safe fonts** - Or fun Google Fonts
3. **Don't be afraid of color** - Neon everything!
4. **Add personality** - This is YOUR site
5. **Have fun** - That's the whole point!
