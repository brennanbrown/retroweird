## Remember When the Web Was Fun?

I've been thinking a lot lately about what we lost when the web became "professional." Sure, modern websites are faster, more accessible, and easier to use. But something important was lost along the way: **personality**.

### What Made the Old Web Special

#### 1. Every Site Was Unique

Back in the day, you could tell who made a website just by looking at it. People weren't using the same templates, the same frameworks, the same design patterns. Every site was a reflection of its creator.

- Crazy color schemes? ✅
- Custom cursors? ✅
- Background music? ✅
- Animated GIFs everywhere? ✅✅✅

#### 2. People Made Sites for Themselves

The old web wasn't about building an audience or making money (well, mostly). People made websites because they *wanted* to. They had something to say, something to share, or they just thought it would be fun.

There was no pressure to:
- Post consistently
- Optimize for SEO
- Build a personal brand
- Go viral
- Monetize everything

#### 3. The Web Was Weird

And I mean that in the best way possible. The barriers to entry were low, but not *so* low that everyone was doing it. You had to be a little bit nerdy, a little bit creative, and willing to learn some HTML.

This created a beautiful ecosystem of weird, wonderful, niche websites made by passionate people.

### What We Lost

When social media took over, we traded:

- **Personal websites** → Profile pages
- **Blogging** → Status updates
- **Web rings** → Algorithms
- **Creativity** → Templates
- **Ownership** → Renting space

Don't get me wrong—social media has its place. But we've given up a lot of creative freedom in exchange for convenience.

### The Revival

The good news? There's a growing movement to bring back the old web:

**[Neocities](https://neocities.org)** has over 500,000 sites and counting.

The **[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)** community is building tools for personal websites.

People are rediscovering the joy of having their own space online.

### How You Can Join

1. **Make a website** - Seriously, just make one. It doesn't have to be perfect.
2. **Make it weird** - Don't follow trends. Make something that's uniquely *you*.
3. **Have fun** - This isn't a job. This is play.
4. **Link to others** - Build a web ring. Make a links page. Support other creators.

### Resources to Get Started

- **Neocities** - Free hosting
- **Eleventy** - Easy static site generator (what this site uses!)
- **Sadgrl.online** - Tutorials and resources
- **The Yesterweb** - Community and inspiration

The web is still here. It's still weird. We just have to remember to make it that way.
