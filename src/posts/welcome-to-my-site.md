## ðŸŽ‰ Hello, World Wide Web!

Welcome to my brand new website! I'm so excited to finally have my own little corner of the internet where I can express myself without algorithms, corporate overlords, or design trends telling me what to do.

### Why Go Retro?

You might be wondering, "Why make a website that looks like it's from 1999?" Great question! Here's why:

1. **Personality Over Perfection** - Modern websites are boring. Everything looks the same. Where's the creativity?
2. **Fun Over Function** - Sometimes you don't need to optimize for conversion rates. Sometimes you just need sparkly GIFs.
3. **Expression Over Engagement** - This isn't about going viral. It's about having fun and being myself.
4. **Nostalgia** - I miss the old web. Let's bring it back!

### What's This Site About?

This site is going to be whatever I want it to be! Expect:

- Random blog posts about things I find interesting
- Cool links to other rad sites
- Experiments with web design
- Maybe some tutorials?
- Definitely more GIFs

### The Technical Stuff

For the nerds out there, this site is built with:

- **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** - An amazing static site generator
- **Nunjucks** - For templating
- **Pure CSS** - No frameworks, just vibes
- **Way too many GIFs** - Because why not?

The theme is called **Retroweird** and it's inspired by GeoCities, MySpace, and all those wonderfully weird personal homepages from the 90s and early 2000s.
